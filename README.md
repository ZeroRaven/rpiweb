# rpiweb
Use the socket to write a simple web server running on your Raspberry Pi. When your server receives a request it should print “Got a request!” to the screen of the Raspberry Pi.  In order to produce the screen shot, you will need to set up your Raspberry Pi, run the server, and type the IP address of your Raspberry Pi into the address line of a web browser running on a desktop or laptop.
